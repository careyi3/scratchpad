# Scratch Pad
Scratch Pad is a browser extension which gives the user a webpage for writing notes which is saved in the browsers local storage.

The app is 100% HTML, vanilla JS and CSS. So it also runs fine as a standalone website. Take a look [here]('https://careyi3.github.io/scratchpad/') for the web version of the app hosted in github pages!
